# Intuitive Overtime Rule

Overtime policies differ by each company; hence, the administrator can face difficulties configuring the Shift.

The overtime rule can be generated based on the flow of time by using the Overtime Pay Code, and daily, weekly, monthly, weekend, and holiday rules can be configured and managed effortlessly.
