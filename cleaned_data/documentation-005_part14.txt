# Server Matching

You can set the server matching. When this option is activated, it performs user authentication matching in BioStar 2, not in the device. It can be used when the device has too much user information or when the device is installed outside.

1. Press [Button] and authenticate with the Admin level credential.
2. Select AUTHENTICATION and activate Server Matching (Fingerprint, Card, ID).

- It is only available for fingerprint, card and ID options.
- When you use the server matching option, you need to activate the option in both Biostar 2 and the device. Refer to the administrator manual of BioStar 2 to learn how to set the server matching settings in BioStar 2.
