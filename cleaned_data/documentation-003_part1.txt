# Overall Architecture of BioStar 2

This architecture allows developers to be dependent from operating systems and programming languages, so it's easy for developers to create a new application and integrate with 3rd party systems. Suprema provides users with BioStar 2 Mobile, which Suprema has developed using BioStar 2 API. Suprema Mobile supports Android and iOS and offers physical access control management features including user management, door management, monitoring and event notifications. In the past, users had to use a PC to perform access control-related tasks like user registration and access control privilege modification for a certain user. However, you can do these tasks anywhere anytime with BioStar 2 Mobile.
