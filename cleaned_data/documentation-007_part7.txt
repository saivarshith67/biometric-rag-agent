# All in a Single Glance - Calendar View of Time Card

With BioStar 2 T&A System’s Time Card, the Daily work hours, used Shift names, normal working hours, exceptions, absences, and holiday states that affect employee schedule and salary can be seen at a glance. This helps the administrator to manage employees efficiently. Furthermore, each user’s punch records can be edited, and absences can be registered to allow for the simple processing of exceptions.
