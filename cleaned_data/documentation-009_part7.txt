# Bug Fixes

1. User ID information was not included when using the BS2_GetLogSmallBlobEx function in the SDK to load the event log for the device's mask detection and temperature measurement operation. (Affects version: v1.1.2)
2. When authenticating on the device where Mask Detection is set and the mask detection method set to Check After Authentication, the Access Success (Check Only) event occurs. (Affects version: v2.0.1)
3. In BioStar v2.9.x, a user transferred to the device having a blurry image as visual face credential gets enrolled normally. (Affects version: v2.0.3)
4. Face gets enrolled normally even if a duplicate face exists on the device. (Affects version: v2.0.3)
5. In the process of enrolling a face on the device, the scanned face image is tilted. (Affects version: v2.0.3)
6. Improved the structure to prevent authentication fail caused by broken database or cache memory. (Affects version: v1.0.0)
7. Door Locked event occurs when input signal gets detected while configured to Arm/Disarm by input signal. (Affects version: v1.0.0)
8. When Dynamic ROI is activated on a device installed using the TCM-10 and the temperature is measured, the background behind the face is also detected and the temperature is measured higher than the actual temperature. (Affects version: v2.0.1)
9. Face authentication suddenly does not work on a device that has been using face authentication for a certain period of time (about 50 days or more). (Affects version: v2.0.3)
