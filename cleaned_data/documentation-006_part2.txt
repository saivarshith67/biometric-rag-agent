# FaceStation 2 | Your face is the key

# Ergonomic design

The angle and position of the cameras on FaceStation 2 are determined so that tall users do not need to bend their back too much. Plus, the different angles of view between the built-in visual and infrared cameras allow users to stand at a position that is most suitable for facial authentication (users can easily locate oneself by trying to locate one’s face at a right position on the screen).
