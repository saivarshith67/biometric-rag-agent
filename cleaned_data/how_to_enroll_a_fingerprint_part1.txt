# How to enroll a fingerprint

# When the fingerprint recognition fails

Suprema device can recognize a fingerprint regardless of a change of season or finger condition. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method.

If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

- If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.
- If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.
- If the finger has a cut, register the fingerprint of another finger.
- The initially registered fingerprint often may have not been scanned correctly, so register the fingerprint again according to ‘Cautions for enrolling a fingerprint’.
