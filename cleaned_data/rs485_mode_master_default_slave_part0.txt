This document will guide you to understand the concept of the changed RS485 mode with BioStar 2.

# RS-485 Mode

Three different RS485 modes are supported as below.

|         | TCP/IP Connection | RS485 Slave Device Search | Device Matching |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Default | O                 | X                         | O               |
| Master  | O                 | O                         | O               |
| Slave   | O                 | X                         | X               |
