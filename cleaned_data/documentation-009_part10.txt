# Bug Fixes

1. When upgrading the firmware from v1.x.x to v2.x.x using a USB memory, the upgrade fails, and when the device is rebooted after removing the USB memory, the device stops in the loading state (Affects version: v1.0.0).
When upgrading the firmware using a USB memory inevitably, first set Menu Timeout to Always On in the Display & Sound menu before proceeding with the upgrade. Also, even if a failure message is displayed during the upgrade, DO NOT remove the USB memory and wait until a success message is displayed. The device will restart automatically when the upgrade is complete.
2. When upgrading the firmware from v1.x.x to v2.x.x while the device memory is full, the device does not boot (Affects version: v1.0.0).
3. The device restarted abnormally after scanning some cards on the device (Affects version: v1.0.0).
4. When communicating with a 3rd party control panel via OSDP, the device does not respond to the Output Status Report command while the relay reacts to it (Affects version: v1.1.2).
5. When communicating with a 3rd party control panel via OSDP, the device incorrectly responds as 'Inactive' when receiving the Input Status Request command while the input port is grounded (Affects version: v1.1.2).
6. When communicating with a 3rd party control panel via OSDP, the device does not respond to the Device Capabilities command (FSF2-DB, FSF2-AB)(Affects version: v1.0.0).
7. The master device restarted abnormally if changing the floor settings after setting up the scheduled unlock zone (Affects version: v1.0.0).
8. When different faces are enrolled in one user, authentication failed with the second enrolled face (Affects version: v1.0.0).
9. When changing the intelligent slave settings on the detailed page of the device on BioStar 2, the settings were not applied (Affects version: v1.1.4).
10. If the user authenticated on the device at the time of Auth Timeout, an incorrect error message was displayed (Affects version: v1.0.0).
