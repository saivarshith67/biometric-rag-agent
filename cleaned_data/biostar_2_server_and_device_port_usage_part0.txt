# BioStar 2 Server and Device Port Usage

BioStar 2 uses several ports to establish device and data communication. This information is crucial if you are installing the devices on remote networks with WAN or VPN. If you need more information regarding connection modes please refer to Connection Modes in BioStar 2.

The server port of BioStar 2 is 51212 by default, but it can be configured to another port in Setting > Server.

# Server to Device

With server to device mode, the device connection is initiated from the BioStar Client and the client makes a connection to the server. This is why you cannot see the device from another client when itâ€™s already connected to a particular client. In this case, the port number is like the below.

| J0 | 0 | 1 |
| -- | - | - |
|    | 1 |   |

If you are installing devices in a remote network, it is recommended that you use device to server, so that the device will automatically connect to the server if it loses connection.
