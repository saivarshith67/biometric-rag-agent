# Connection Modes in BioStar 2

The concept of device connection is different in BioStar 2 compared to BioStar 1's server mode and direct mode.

1. Log upload is automatic regardless of the connection type if you set the Log Upload to automatic in Setting &gt; Server.
2. Device connection is automatic if the device gets disconnected regardless of the connection type.
3. Connection type is not called direct mode or server mode.

- It is either Server → Device connection (default) or Device → Server.
- Use Device → Server mode if the devices remain disconnected often on the default connection mode.

# Configuring Device to Server Connection

1. Select your device in the device tree at the DEVICE menu.
2. On the Network &gt; Server tab check Device &gt; Server Connection.
3. Enter your IP and Server Port.
