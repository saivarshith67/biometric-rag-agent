| Power         | Power is supplied to the device, but the device does not work.                           | • If the terminal is apart from the bracket, it may not work due to the tamper switch. • Check the adapter or power connection cable. • For a normal user's PIN, contact your administrator and then enter the PIN again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| PIN           | I've lost my PIN.                                                                        | • If an administration's PIN is lost, contact your installer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|               | I cannot open a locked door when I enter a PIN and then press the OK button.             | • Check whether the registered PIN is entered correctly. • Check whether the PIN has recently been changed. • If you cannot find the PIN, contact your administrator to change the PIN. • Refer to ‘How to Register Fingerprints’, and then enroll the fingerprint again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Fingerprint   | A fingerprint is enrolled successfully, but the fingerprint recognition fails too often. | • Since there are variations in recognition rates due to the different characteristics of each fingerprint, please try to enroll another fingerprint. • If there are many number of enrolled fingerprints, change the Matching Timeout setting and then try again. • If a finger is injured, the finger may be recognized as another person's finger.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|               | The fingerprint recognition does not work.                                               | • Check whether the finger or the fingerprint sensor has sweat, water, or dust on it, and then wipe it clear. • Try again after clearing the finger and the fingerprint sensor with a dry cloth. • If the finger is too dry, try again after blowing gently on the finger. • When Sensor Mode set to Auto On, the fingerprint sensor detects if a finger is present. And the sensor is on while the finger is present on the sensor. If you want to keep the fingerprint sensor on, go to AUTHENTICATION > Fingerprint > Sensor Mode and then select Always On. |
| Door lock     | The lock does not work when the door is closed.                                          | • The electric lock may have a problem. Ask your installer to examine it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Time          | The time displayed on the device is not correct.                                         | • Even though BioStation 2 includes an internal battery, the time could become incorrect due to the discharge of the internal battery if power has not been applied to the system for a long time. Refer to Date & Time to adjust the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Administrator | The administrator mode cannot be accessed due to losing the administrator PIN.           | • If the administrator menu cannot be accessed, it is possible to get a PIN issued in accordance with a predefined procedure. Ask your installer about the procedure to issue a password.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
