# Introducing BioStar 2’s Time and Attendance System

# Schedule

Schedule allows the structuring of a work schedule by designating the Schedule template, period, holiday, and users. To configure a Schedule, the Time Code, Shift, and Schedule Template has to be configured beforehand, and user and holiday information configured in the BioStar 2 AC module are required as well.

A temporary schedule is particularly useful when temporarily assigning a shift for users because it overrides the normal schedule for a certain period. For example, the Schedule Template has to be reconfigured if a user with a fixed working rule is to be set to use the flexible shift on a specific period of time, but if a Temporary Schedule is registered, it can be configured with a few clicks. Temporary Schedule is similar to BioStar 1’s Shift Override Management, but the function in BioStar 1 requires an upgrade to the SE version.
