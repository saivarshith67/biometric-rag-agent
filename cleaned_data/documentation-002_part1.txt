# BioStar2 V2.6.0 – Database Table

# Cautions

# Generic Cautions

# A. Isolation Level

If tx_isolation in Maria DB’s Global/Session variable is REPEATABLE READ avoid using INSERT INTO ~, SELECT ~, CREATE TABLE AS ~ SELECT ~

- Alternative: Configure and use tx_isolation as READ UNCOMMITTED or READ COMMITTED.
- Reference: Isolation Level

# B. Multiple Sessions

Avoid using REPLACE INTO ~ with multiple DB sessions. The REPLACE INTO ~ operation executes two operations of DELETE ~ and INSERT INTO ~ as one operation and when this status is linked with the isolation level mentioned above, a dead-lock may occur.

- Alternative: Use INSERT INTO ~ ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ~
- Reference 1: Replace
- Reference 2: INSERT on duplicate key update

# C. Self-reference

Self-reference should not be used if possible when executing an update or insert query. If a self-referencing SELECT statement is included in an update or insert query, many locks will be held which may lead to performance decrease. Furthermore, a reference to a table with a foreign key constraint may also provide a similar result as a self-reference.

- Example 1: UPDATE T_USR SET NM = (SELECT NM FROM T_USR WHERE USRID = '1111');
- Example 2: INSERT INTO T_USR (A, B, C, D) SELECT 'a', 'b', 'c', D FROM T_USR;

# D. Transactions

Transactions (batch jobs) should be held shortly as possible unless it is an insert and update execution for a large number of rows.

# E. DDL Usage

DDL usage within a transaction will execute an implicit commit which may result in unintended results. (Rollback is not possible)
