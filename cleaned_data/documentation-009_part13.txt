# Bug Fixes

1. The device rebooted abnormally when adding an occupancy limit zone. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
2. When the LAN connection of the device configured in the occupancy limit zone was removed, the device rebooted abnormally if a user belonging to the bypass group authenticated on the entry device. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
3. An abnormal IP address was set when using DHCP. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
4. If some ports of the OM-120 connected as a slave are set as a door relay and the device is rebooted, the relay was operated abnormally. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
5. If the device is rebooted with Live Finger Detection turned on, then the device fails to detect a fake fingerprint. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
6. Abnormal authentication failure occurred when the slave device’s auth mode was set to card+fingerprint. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
7. PIN authentication did not work properly. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
8. Renamed and improved the light brightness feature (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
- Changed the option name from ‘LED Brightness’ to ‘Light Brightness’.
- Fixed the device to automatically operate as ‘Normal’ option when the administrator sets the light brightness to an invalid option.
9. After setting the auth mode to include fingerprint and fingerprint/PIN, an abnormal error message is displayed if a user whose fingerprint or PIN is not enrolled authenticates on a slave device that does not support Extended Private Auth Mode. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
10. If the face auth mode was not used for more than 10 hours and then activated, the face authentication did not work. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
11. When using server matching, the device rebooted abnormally during the loading if a user with an Operator Level of ‘None’ inquires about the event log. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
- This issue was caused by a conflict between uploading event logs to the server and outputting the user’s event logs when the device has a large number of event logs that have not been uploaded to the server for a long period of time.
12. Capturing and authenticating face images in the background was activated during operations unrelated to face authentication. (Affects version: v1.1.1 or earlier)
