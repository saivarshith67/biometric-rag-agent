| Fingerprint        | Security Level | Normal   |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------- |
| Matching Timeout   | View Image     | Disabled |
| Sensor Sensitivity | I:N Fast Mode  | Auto     |
| Template Format    | SUPREMA        |          |
| Sensor Mode        | Auto On        |          |

3. Select an item and press the / buttons to change the settings.

- Security Level: Configures the security level for 1:N Authentication.
- Timeout: Sets a timeout period. If the authentication is not completed within the set time, the authentication fails.
- View Image: You can view the original image when a fingerprint is scanned.
- Sensor Sensitivity: Sets the sensitivity level of the fingerprint reader sensor. Set the sensor sensitivity high if you wish to use a higher sensor sensitivity level and obtain more detailed fingerprint information.
- 1:N Fast Mode: Sets the fingerprint authentication speed. Select Auto On to have the authentication speed configured according to the total fingerprint templates enrolled on the device.
- Template Format: Sets the fingerprint template format. The default format is SUPREMA. Be careful when changing the template format as it can render all previously stored fingerprints unusable.
- Sensor Mode: If Auto On is selected, the fingerprint sensor detects if a finger is present. And the sensor is on while the finger is present on the sensor. If Always On is selected, the fingerprint sensor is always on.
- Advanced Enrollment: You can check the quality of a scanned fingerprint to save high quality fingerprint data. If Enabled is selected, the user will be notified when the fingerprint quality is low. This helps users to scan the fingerprints correctly.

4. Press OK to save the settings.

# NOTE

- Change the template type after deleting all user fingerprint information. If there is any user fingerprint information stored on the device, the template type cannot be changed.
