# Firmware Version 1.1.4 (Build No. 1.1.4_220315)

Release: 2022-03-22

Before upgrading this firmware, proceed with ‘Delete Data & Sync Device’ to prevent a very rare case of device lock-up.

# New Features and Improvements

1. Changed firmware upgrade method according to dualization for the front cover (LCD & touchpad).
2. Improved to extract a new visual face template from the warped image only if necessary after checking the template version (Algorithm compatibility) when sending templates from BioStar 2 or BioStar 2 Device SDK.

# Bug Fixes

1. Structural issues were found in the flash memory (Affects version: v1.1.2 or earlier).
- Long usage of some scenarios could overflow the database, causing the device to lose the ability to boot.
2. After upgrading the firmware, the touchpad recognizes a different part from where the user actually touched (Affects version: v1.1.3).
3. Slave devices were disconnected when the master device was rebooted (Affects version: v1.1.2 or earlier).
4. The device failed to recognize the iCLASS Seos card intermittently before rebooting the device (FSF2-AB) (Affects version: v1.1.2 or earlier).
5. When synchronizing user data from the device to the BioStar2 server and retransmitting it to the device, only some users were transmitted or took a long time to transmit.
- When a low-quality visual face warped image is synchronized to another device, the synchronization speed is slowed down by continuously retrying synchronization after the template extraction fails on that device due to the low quality (Affects version: v1.1.2 or earlier).
6. If the ‘Access Granted’ event was set in Trigger & Action, the temperature was abnormally displayed as ‘NaN’ when a user authenticated on the device (Affects version: v1.1.0 or later, v1.1.2 or earlier).
