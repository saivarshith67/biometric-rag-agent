# Migrating domain settings when reinstalling BioStar 2

# BioStar 2, FAQ

If you uninstall BioStar 2 and reinstall it after you have to use the cloud setting in BioStar 2, you will not be able to use the same subdomain name. However, if you back up the setting.conf file and overwrite the file in your new installation, you should be able to reuse the subdomain name.

# Procedure

1. Open File Explorer in Windows.
2. Go to the BioStar2 Installation folder as shown below and find the file: ~~setting.conf~~
- In case of installed BioStar 2 for 32bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\BioStar 2
- In case of installed BioStar 2 for 64bit: C:\Program Files\BioStar 2\BioStar 2(x64)
3. Right click on the file and click Open.
