# How to change from HTTP to HTTPS

Can we use HTTPS for BioStar 2?

Yes, the BioStar 2 supports a secure communication protocol called HTTPs between the BioStar 2 Server and the BioStar 2 Clients. HTTPs consists of communication over HTTP with encryption of Secure Socket Layer. This will provide protection of the privacy and the integrity of the data exchanged between the BioStar 2 Server and the BioStar 2 Clients.

If you are going to use the HTTPS protocol, you must apply the certificate (steps 8 and following). If the certificate is not applied, you will experience slowness and other erratic behavior on the web client such as no response to clicks.
