# Suprema’s Live Finger Detection Technology

The LDE can block fake fingerprints made from paper, film, glue, rubber, clay and silicon all together by comparing images obtained with white lights and infrared rays.

The new OP5 sensor applied to Suprema’s recently released fingerprint readers has reduced distortion and improved contrast uniformity, and features Adaptive Gain Control algorithm and a proximity sensor, which enables the sensor to detect fake fingerprints made from paper, film, glue, rubber, clay and silicon all together.
