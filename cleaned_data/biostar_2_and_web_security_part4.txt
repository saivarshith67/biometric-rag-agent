# BioStar 2 and Web Security

Client is called signature verification. Therefore, the purpose of this method is not to protect data but to guarantee the identity of the person providing the data.

# Encryption Algorithms

- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem)
- DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)

# Advantages

- A secure channel, which is necessary for a symmetric-key encryption, is not necessary since the public key is used.
- Users are safe from external attacks because encryption and decryption is done through two different keys.

# Disadvantages

- Asymmetric Encryption is around 100~1000 times slower than symmetric-key encryption.
- It requires more resources than symmetric-key encryption.

# Combining Symmetric-Key and Asymmetric-Key Encryption

Symmetric-key encryption and asymmetric-key encryption both have their special advantages but also have problems of key transport and degraded performance. Consequently, a hybrid cryptosystem was developed to ameliorate these issues.

The communication method using SSL certification and a hybrid cryptosystem is a combination of symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.
