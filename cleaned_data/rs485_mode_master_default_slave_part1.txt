One master device can connect up to 31 devices, but up to 8 fingerprint devices are able to be connectable through RS485. We recommend minimum number of RS485 connected fingerprint devices considering the number of users and connected devices. This is because it can lead to slow matching speed depending on the device which is used for “Master” device.
