Quality comparison of JPEG and WSQ fingerprint images based on the same compression ratio: In JPEG, discontinuation of ridges occur due to blocking artifact.

The image compression technology applied to SFM5500 is a standard WSQ image compression technology of NIST and has been certified by NIST and the FBI. Therefore, any WSQ compression stream sent from SFM is restorable using any viewer with an FBI-certified decoder.
