Live Face Detection

FaceStation 2 analyzes the actual photo and the IR image based on its dual camera system and intelligent machine learning algorithm. Hardware-dependent live face detection systems (e.g. facial thermogram recognition, facial vein recognition) require expensive hardware components and provide less accurate matches and slower performance in authentication. Supremaâ€™s live face detection technology provides users with ideal accuracy and speed for access control and time and attendance management.
