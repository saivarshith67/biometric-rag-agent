# How to delete blacklisted CSN cards on BioStar 2

# Summary of the issue

In BioStar 2, you can currently (version 2.2.1, 4/29/16)

- Block (blacklist) a CSN card and delete card
- Block (blacklist) a CSN card and delete the user

In such cases, you cannot reuse this card because it remains in the Blacklist and there is no way to delete it from the list.

The best way to prevent such problems is to delete the user after unblocking the card so please keep that in mind.

In future versions of BioStar 2 you will be able to delete such Blacklisted cards, but for now, you can use the temporary solution below to delete the Blacklisted card.

This solution only applies for CSN cards. You cannot delete a blacklisted Smart Card with this process.

If you're looking for a solution for BioStar 2.3 or above refer to the Freshdesk FAQ Link.

# Procedure

1. Find the card CSN in Setting > Card > Blacklist Card and write the number down.
2. Stop BioStar 2 service in BioStar Setting.
