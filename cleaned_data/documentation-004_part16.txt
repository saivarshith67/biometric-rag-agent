# Installation

# Connecting to Secure I/O 2

Secure I/O 2 is an I/O device, can be connected to FaceStation F2 with the RS-485 cable. Security can be maintained even if the connection between FaceStation F2 and Secure I/O 2 has been lost or the power supply to FaceStation F2 has been shut off due to external factors.

- Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.
- If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Î©) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

| RS-485 connection |        | Power supply connection |                      |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1 - 485 TRXP      | Blue   | 1 - PWR +VDC            | Red (white stripe)   |
| 2 - 485 TRXN      | Yellow | 2 - PWR GND             | Black (white stripe) |
| 3 - 485 GND       | Black  |                         |                      |
| 4 - SH GND        | Gray   |                         |                      |

DC power

FaceStation F2 can be used as a multi-door controller with the slave devices with the RS-485 cable. The slave devices are used as dummy readers and authentication is performed in the master device.

- If a fingerprint authentication device is configured as a slave device in FaceStation F2, you cannot add another FaceStation F2 as a slave device.
- If the fingerprint authentication device is the master device, FaceStation F2 cannot be added as a slave device.
- If BioStation 3 is a master device, FaceStation F2 cannot be used as a slave device, and vice versa.
- When you connect FaceStation F2 as a slave device while FaceStation F2 is the master device, only one FaceStation F2 can be added as a slave device.
- When FaceStation F2 is the master device and another FaceStation F2 is connected to it as a slave device, you can connect one additional Secure I/O 2 and DM-20 each.
- When FaceStation F2 is the master device and another FaceStation F2 is connected to it as a slave device, you cannot connect additional OM-120.
- The maximum number of slave devices available to connect varies according to the authentication method, number of users, and number of devices. Also note that the number of slave devices affects the authentication speed.
- A master device can control 31 slave devices. The bandwidth of RS-485 allows for up to 7 fingerprint authentication devices to be connected.
