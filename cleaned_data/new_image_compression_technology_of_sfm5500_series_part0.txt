# New Image Compression Technology of SFM5500 Series

Fingerprint Image Compression Certified by FBI WSQ Specification, Version 3.1

It has been nearly impractical to use the SFM series in sending fingerprint images, as it provides only UART serial communication, which supplies a stable network speed of 115,200 bps. For this reason, when sending a fingerprint image from SFM to Host PC, users used to quantize from the original format to 4-bit gray or binary format, which resulted in an image quality that is significantly compromised. (Figure 1)

The SFM5500 series overcame this problem and have been equipped with the new technology to compress fingerprint images and quickly send high quality images via a low bandwidth network environment. When compressing, the quality degradation is minimized (Figure 2), but the data size is lowered by 90%, reducing the time it takes to be sent by 90%, as well. Moreover, you can set the system to compress images in different levels, enabling you to appropriately adjust the transfer speed and the image quality according to its use (Figure 3).
