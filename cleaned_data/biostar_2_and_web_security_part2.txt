The size of symmetric keys are generally 128 or 256 bits and it is more difficult to crack passwords with larger keys. For example, the 128 bit key can have 2128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 different combinations of passwords and it would take thousands of years in order to crack a 128 bit key with brute-force attack.

# Encryption Algorithms

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- 3DES
- IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)
- Blowfish
- Twofish
- Serpent
- CAST5
- RC4

# Advantages

- Since one key is used, messages and files can be encrypted and decrypted alone by the key holder.
- This method is 100~1000 times faster than the public key encryption which uses two keys.
- Less resources are used because only one key is encrypted.

# Disadvantages

- There needs to be a secure channel which will allow sending and receiving of the symmetric key.
- Since the sender and receiver uses the same key, the message received from a specific user cannot be verified. There is no method to check if the received message matches the original message if another user who has the same symmetric key changes the message in the middle. Hence, the user is vulnerable to hacks if the symmetric key is exposed.
- If there are many connecting users, a key distribution problem will occur and will consume.
