# Introducing BioStar 2’s Time and Attendance System

Each report can be exported as a CSV file.

# Key Features

# Tracking of All T&A Issues

BioStar 2’s T&A System is not merely an employee Check-in and Check-out tracking system. Work, Break, Meal, Leave type, and times that are related to employee payroll can also be tracked. Furthermore, time and attendance records edited by the administrator can be seen in a single glance.

# Customizable Time Code

Time code (once called Pay Code), which is the core element of the Shift, can be created unlimitedly in BioStar 2’s T&A System. All company policies can be supported by combining Time Code Type, Time Rate, and Option (Worked, Not Worked).
