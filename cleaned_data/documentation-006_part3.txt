# FaceStation 2 | Your face is the key

Accommodating a broad array of RFID cards with Multi-RFID technology

FaceStation 2 features Multi-RFID technology, supporting 125 kHz and 13.56 MHz cards all together. If a customer is using 125 kHz cards such as EM and HID Prox and wants to change the access cards to a more advanced and secure 13.56 MHz cards (Mifare, Mifare DESFire, Felica, iClass), then employees at the customerâ€™s site can use both 125 kHz and 13.56 MHz during the transition period. FaceStation 2 also supports NFC and BLE communication technologies.

# SIP-based VoIP videophone

FaceStation 2 works as a SIP (session initiation protocol) videophone as well, eliminating the need to install a separate videophone. If a SIP server is already installed at the site, you can utilize the existing SIP infrastructure. Otherwise, customers can install a well-known open source SIP server recommended and tested by Suprema to utilize FaceStation 2 as a videophone.
