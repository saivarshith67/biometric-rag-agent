# How to set BioStar 2 and device time

This is mainly because the device time zone setting is to support the case of managing devices in different locations from one single server.

# Access Group Time Zone Setting

If you have branches in different time zones, the access control time will need to be different based on their time zones.

For example, at HQ, it has an access group rule that employees can enter the office from 7 AM to 4 PM during weekdays. With the device time zone setting, the same rule can be easily applied to the devices in different time zones.

The server time zone is set to be as below.

| Language | TimeZone                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| English  | (UTC+9) Seoul; Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo, Kakut |

● Current Time is 15:56

● Two devices and doors are created.

Here, for example, the below time zone is created and used for the access group setting.
