0,"Correct fingerprint enrollment is critical in improving fingerprint recognition. BioStation 2 is loaded with powerful fingerprint algorithm which is capable of recognizing a fingerprint even when the angle or position of the finger on the reader is not optimal. Nevertheless, enrolling a fingerprint with the following instructions can improve the recognition performance.

Choose Ideal Fingers to Enroll:
• Each person can enroll up to ten fingerprints. If a finger is injured or scratched, it is recommended to use another finger.
• If the fingerprint recognition fails, you can enroll the same finger multiple times, which will improves the recognition performance.
• If a finger is injured or the fingerprint is not clear, please enroll a different finger.
• The index finger and middle finger are preferred for enrolling fingerprints. Other fingers may have a lower recognition rate because those fingers tend to have difficulty being placed at the center of the fingerprint sensor.

How to Enroll Fingerprints:
1 When enrolling a fingerprint, the “Scan 1st finger” message will appear on the LCD screen. Place a finger on the fingerprint sensor, and then press softly in order to improve the recognition.
2 After a beep sounds, you will be notified to scan again then remove your finger and place it again to scan. (You are required to scan the same finger twice for enrollment.)",What is the procedure for fingerprint enrollment?,"To enroll a fingerprint on the BioStation 2, start by selecting an ideal finger—preferably the index or middle finger. Avoid injured or unclear fingerprints. When the prompt 'Scan 1st finger' appears on the LCD screen, gently place your finger on the sensor. After a beep, lift and re-place the same finger to complete the second scan. The system requires two scans of the same finger to finalize the enrollment. For improved recognition accuracy, you can also register the same finger multiple times."
1,"Correct face enrollment and authentication method

Cautions for enrolling a face:
• When enrolling a face, maintain a distance of 60–100 cm between the device and the face.
• Do not change your face expression.
• Do not wear masks, hats, or eye patches.
• Do not enroll a face wearing a mask. It may increase the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) if both faces with and without a mask are enrolled.
• Do not raise head up or lower head.
• Do not wear thick makeup.
• Do not close your eyes.
• Make sure that both of your shoulders correctly appear on the screen.
• Stand still and enroll your face by staring at the screen.
• Be careful not to display two faces on the screen. Enroll one person at a time.
• If you do not follow the instructions on the screen, the face enrollment may take longer or may fail.",How should a face be enrolled on the FaceStation F2?,"To enroll a face on the FaceStation F2, stand approximately 60–100 cm away from the device. Maintain a neutral expression and avoid wearing accessories like masks, hats, or glasses that may obstruct facial features. Ensure your eyes are open and that both shoulders are clearly visible in the frame. Only one person should appear on screen during enrollment to avoid confusion. Remain still and follow the on-screen guidance closely to ensure the system captures a high-quality facial template."
2,"Suprema’s Live Finger Detection (LFD) technology is based on analysis of dynamic and static image characteristics of the fake fingers, and how they can be distinguished from those of live fingers. With the advanced analysis algorithm to detect abnormalities in dynamic changing pattern of fingerprints images, and several static features of liveness or unnaturalness of fingers, fake fingers are clearly distinguished from live fingers.

Dynamic changing pattern analysis:
Live fingers naturally demonstrate changes in patterns of area, intensity, and movement, while fake fingers produce unnatural changing patterns of separated areas, partially dark area, distorted boundary shape, and large movement of core part.

Liveness feature analysis:
There are localized features in fingerprint images that reveal liveness: pore distribution, ridge sharpness, and boundary regularity. These are difficult to replicate with materials like silicon or rubber.",What is Suprema's Live Finger Detection (LFD) technology?,"Suprema's Live Finger Detection (LFD) technology enhances security by distinguishing between real and fake fingerprints. It uses two key analyses: (1) dynamic pattern detection, which examines natural variations in fingerprint contact such as area, intensity, and movement; and (2) liveness feature analysis, which checks for biological details like pores and ridge sharpness that are hard to replicate. This dual approach helps reject spoofing attempts made with materials like rubber, silicone, or paper."
