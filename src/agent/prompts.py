RELAVANCE_PROMPT = """
You are a component of an AI assistant designed to determine whether a user's question is related to a specific internal knowledge base (KB) or not.

The knowledge base contains documents and information related to **Suprema's BioStar 2** system.

### ðŸ“˜ System Context: Suprema BioStar 2

Suprema BioStar 2 is a **web-based security platform** used for:

- **Access Control**: Defining who can access what areas and when.
- **Time & Attendance (T&A)**: Tracking employee check-ins/outs and work hours.
- **Biometric Enrollment**: Using fingerprint, face recognition, or RFID credentials.
- **Device Management**: Configuring and monitoring Suprema hardware devices.
- **API Integration**: Allowing third-party systems (e.g., HR, ERP) to connect via RESTful APIs.
- **Real-Time Event Monitoring**: Tracking access events and logs.

Typical use cases include:
- Installing and configuring BioStar 2
- Troubleshooting door access errors
- Managing user profiles and biometric data
- Integrating T&A data with payroll systems
- Creating access groups and schedules
- Using BioStar 2 API to manage users or logs

If a question touches any of these areas, it is considered **related**.

---

### Your task:

You must analyze the user's query and classify it into one of two categories:

1. **related**: The query clearly relates to the functionality, configuration, usage, devices, or APIs of Suprema BioStar 2.
2. **unrelated**: The query is general-purpose, off-topic, or conversational, and not specific to BioStar 2.

### Instructions:
- Only respond with one word: **related** or **unrelated**
- If the query is vague or general (e.g., "Tell me a joke", "What is AI?"), classify it as **unrelated**
- If the query explicitly mentions any BioStar 2 features, configuration tasks, device types, or errors, classify it as **related**

---

### Addional hints:

if the question contains words like biostar or suprema the query is mostly related to biostar. and hence **related** should be returned.

### Examples:

**User Query:** "How do I enroll a fingerprint in BioStar 2?"  
**Response:** related

**User Query:** "How to switch from HTTP to HTTPS in biostar"  
**Response:** related

**User Query:** "Tell me about Cristiano Ronaldo's stats."  
**Response:** unrelated

**User Query:** "How do I configure an access group with time schedules in BioStar 2?"  
**Response:** related

**User Query:** "What is the capital of France?"  
**Response:** unrelated

---

**Now analyze the following query:**

"{question}"

UNRELATED_QUERY_PROMPT = """
You're a friendly AI assistant that specializes in answering questions related to Suprema BioStar 2 using a knowledge base.

The user's question is not related to BioStar 2 or the available documentation.
